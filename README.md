### 🧠 Advanced Risk Logic Explained

Beyond simple volatility metrics, the system employs a multi-layered approach to dynamically adjust risk parameters based on market conditions and trade confidence. This results in more nuanced and context-aware risk management.

#### 1. Confidence Scoring Model

Instead of treating all trade setups equally, the system calculates a **Confidence Score** for each position to quantify the quality of the setup. This score is based on a blend of five distinct factors:

1.  **Trend Strength (EMA Crossover):** Checks if the short-term trend (20-period EMA) is aligned with the position's direction relative to the longer-term trend (50-period EMA). A score is awarded if the trend is favorable.
2.  **Breakout Confirmation (Donchian Channels):** Determines if the current price has recently broken out of its 20-period price range, providing confirmation for the trade's direction.
3.  **Volatility Regime:** Compares the short-term volatility (20-period standard deviation of returns) to the longer-term median volatility (100-period). A score is awarded for low-volatility regimes (less noise) and penalized for high-volatility regimes.
4.  **Price Momentum (RSI Proxy):** Uses a 14-period RSI calculation to gauge momentum. A score is awarded if the RSI is above 50 for long positions or below 50 for short positions.
5.  **Volatility Model Stability:** Compares the annualized volatility forecasts from the GARCH and HAR-RV models. If the models are in close agreement, it increases confidence. If they diverge significantly, it reduces confidence, indicating market uncertainty.

The final score is clamped between -2 and +5 and directly influences the risk parameters.

#### 2. Dynamic Risk Target Adjustment

The system can dynamically adjust the percentage of capital risked on a trade based on the **Confidence Score**. This allows for taking slightly more risk on high-quality setups and less risk on low-quality ones.

-   The base risk is defined in `settings.toml` (e.g., `base_target_pct = 0.025`).
-   A multiplier is applied based on the score:
    -   High Confidence (Score ≥ 4): **1.2x** multiplier (e.g., 3.0% risk)
    -   Medium Confidence (Score ≥ 2): **1.0x** multiplier (e.g., 2.5% risk)
    -   Low Confidence (Score ≥ 0): **0.9x** multiplier (e.g., 2.25% risk)
    -   Negative Confidence (Score < 0): **0.8x** multiplier (e.g., 2.0% risk)
-   The final risk target is clipped within a professional range (e.g., 2.0% to 3.0%) defined in the configuration.

#### 3. Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Multipliers

The multipliers used to set the Stop-Loss (`k`) and Take-Profit (`m`) distances are not static. they are adjusted using a three-factor model to adapt to market conditions:

1.  **Base Multiplier (Leverage):** The initial `k` and `m` values are selected from the configuration based on the position's leverage. Higher leverage results in tighter base multipliers.
2.  **Volatility Adjustment:** The multipliers are then adjusted based on the current volatility regime (measured by ATR as a percentage of price). In very high-volatility environments, stops are widened to avoid premature stop-outs, while in low-volatility environments, they are tightened.
3.  **Confidence Adjustment:** Finally, the multipliers are fine-tuned based on the **Confidence Score**. A higher score results in slightly tighter stops and more aggressive profit targets, as the system has more confidence in the trade's direction.

This multi-factor approach ensures that the final SL/TP levels are tailored specifically to the asset's current leverage, volatility, and the quality of the trade setup.

### 2. GARCH Volatility Triggers (`garch_vol_triggers.py`)

Advanced volatility analysis using multiple models:

**Volatility Models:**

#### GARCH(1,1) Model
- Models volatility clustering and mean reversion
- Provides short-term volatility forecasts
- More sensitive to recent market conditions
- Weight: 30% in blended estimate

#### HAR-RV (Heterogeneous Autoregressive Realized Volatility)
- Uses realized volatility from different time horizons
- More stable long-term volatility estimates
- Better for trend-following strategies
- Weight: 40% in blended estimate

#### ATR (Average True Range)
- Simple volatility measure based on price ranges
- Used as fallback when advanced models fail
- Good for quick volatility assessment
- Weight: 30% in blended estimate

**Blending Logic:**
```python
# Outlier detection and blending
if garch_sigma and har_sigma:
    ratio = garch_sigma / har_sigma
    if ratio > outlier_threshold:
        # Use HAR if GARCH is outlier
        blended_sigma = har_sigma
    else:
        # Weighted blend
        blended_sigma = (w_garch * garch_sigma + 
                        w_har * har_sigma + 
                        w_atr * atr_sigma)
else:
    # Fallback to ATR
    blended_sigma = atr_sigma
```

### 3. Portfolio Correlation Analysis

**New Feature**: Automatically identifies correlated positions and applies risk caps:

```python
# Correlation clustering algorithm
1. Fetch 4h returns for all positions (60-day lookback)
2. Calculate correlation matrix
3. Group positions with |correlation| ≥ 0.7 into clusters
4. Cap total cluster risk at 50% of portfolio risk budget
5. Scale down cluster members proportionally 
```

**Example Output:**
```
📊 PORTFOLIO SUMMARY

### Risk/Reward Calculation Logic

The system calculates risk/reward using **optimal position sizing**:

1. **Target Risk**: Configurable (default 2.5% of position notional)
2. **Volatility Forecast**: Uses blended GARCH/HAR-RV/ATR models
3. **SL Distance**: `k × σ_H × entry_price` (k = 0.8-1.8 based on leverage)
4. **TP Distance**: `m × σ_H × entry_price` (m = 1.8-4.0 based on leverage)
5. **Optimal Size**: `target_risk / sl_distance`
6. **Risk/Reward**: `tp_distance / sl_distance`

### Position Sizing Recommendations

The system compares current vs optimal position sizes:

- **Current < 0.5× Optimal**: Position too small for proper risk management
- **Current > 1.5× Optimal**: Position too large, consider reducing
- **0.5× ≤ Current ≤ 1.5× Optimal**: Position size appropriate

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### API Connection Errors
```
Error: Failed to connect to exchange API
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify your API credentials in `settings.toml`
- Check if your IP is whitelisted on the exchange
- Ensure you have the correct permissions (read positions, read account)
- Try using sandbox mode first: `sandbox = true`
- Check your internet connection and firewall settings

#### Authentication Errors
```
Error: Invalid API key or signature
```
**Solutions:**
- Double-check your API key and secret in the configuration
- Ensure there are no extra spaces or characters
- Verify the API key has the required permissions
- Check if the API key is expired or disabled

#### No Positions Found
```
Warning: No open positions found
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify you have open positions on the exchange
- Check if you're using the correct account (main vs. sub-account)
- Ensure the exchange module is correctly configured
- Try running in sandbox mode to test connectivity

#### GARCH Model Errors
```
Error: GARCH model failed to converge
```
**Solutions:**
- Insufficient historical data: The model needs at least 50 data points
- High volatility in data: Try adjusting the `garch_window` parameter
- Convergence issues: Reduce the forecast horizon or increase the window size
- Check for data quality issues (missing values, outliers)

#### Configuration Issues
```
Error: Configuration file not found
```
**Solutions:**
- Copy `settings.example.toml` to `settings.toml`
- Ensure all required fields are filled
- Check TOML syntax for any formatting errors
- Validate configuration with: `python -c "import tomli; tomli.load(open('settings.toml', 'rb'))"`

#### Memory and Performance Issues
```
Error: Out of memory or slow performance
```
**Solutions:**
- Reduce the `garch_window` size
- Limit the number of positions analyzed
- Disable parallel processing: `parallel_processing = false`
- Increase memory limit in configuration
- Close other applications to free up memory

#### Adaptive Stop-Loss Errors
```
Error: Failed to calculate adaptive levels
```
**Solutions:**
- Check if market data is available for the symbol
- Verify ATR calculation has sufficient data
- Ensure position data contains required fields
- Try disabling adaptive stop-loss temporarily

## 📚 Technical Details

### Volatility Models

#### GARCH(1,1) Model
```
σ²_t = ω + α₁r²_{t-1} + β₁σ²_{t-1}
```
Where:
- `σ²_t`: Conditional variance at time t
- `r²_{t-1}`: Squared return at time t-1
- `ω, α₁, β₁`: Model parameters

#### HAR-RV Model
```
log(RV_{t+1}) = c + β_D log(RV_D) + β_W log(RV_W) + β_M log(RV_M)
```
Where:
- `RV_D`: Daily realized volatility
- `RV_W`: Weekly realized volatility  
- `RV_M`: Monthly realized volatility

### Risk Calculation Formula

```
SL_distance = k × σ_H × entry_price
TP_distance = m × σ_H × entry_price
Optimal_Size = target_risk / SL_distance
```

Where `σ_H` is the volatility forecast for the target horizon.

### Correlation Analysis Algorithm

```
1. Fetch 4h returns for all positions (configurable lookback)
2. Calculate pairwise correlation matrix
3. Apply threshold-based clustering:
   - Start with each symbol as its own cluster
   - Merge clusters if any member has |corr| ≥ threshold
4. For each cluster:
   - Calculate total cluster risk
   - If cluster risk > cap_pct × total_risk:
     - Scale down all cluster members proportionally
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 📊 **1. What does "Maximum Portfolio Risk" mean? Is it based on notional value or margin used?**

**Maximum Portfolio Risk** refers to the **total dollar amount at risk across all positions** if all stop-losses are hit simultaneously. This is calculated based on **notional values**, not margin used.

**Key Points:**
- **Calculation**: `Total Risk = Sum of (Position Notional × Risk Target %)` for all positions
- **Example**: If you have 3 positions with $10,000, $15,000, and $5,000 notional values, each risking 2.5%, your total portfolio risk would be $750
- **Not Margin-Based**: This is independent of leverage or margin requirements
- **Purpose**: Ensures you never risk more than a predetermined percentage of your total portfolio value

```python
# Example calculation
position_1_risk = 10000 * 0.025 = $250  # 2.5% of $10k notional
position_2_risk = 15000 * 0.025 = $375  # 2.5% of $15k notional  
position_3_risk = 5000 * 0.025 = $125   # 2.5% of $5k notional
total_portfolio_risk = $250 + $375 + $125 = $750
```

**Configuration:**
```toml
[risk]
max_portfolio_risk = 0.02  # 2% of total portfolio value
```

---

### 🎯 **2. What is "Risk Target" and what does it mean?**

**Risk Target** is the **percentage of a position's notional value** that you're willing to lose if the stop-loss is hit. This is dynamically adjusted based on the confidence score of each trade setup.

**How It Works:**
1. **Base Risk Target**: Set in configuration (default: 2.5% of position notional)
2. **Confidence Multiplier**: Applied based on trade quality assessment
3. **Final Risk Target**: Clamped within professional limits (2.0% - 3.0%)

**Dynamic Adjustment Formula:**
```python
# Base configuration
base_target_pct = 0.025  # 2.5%
min_target_pct = 0.020   # 2.0% 
max_target_pct = 0.030   # 3.0%

# Confidence-based multiplier
if confidence_score >= 4:    # High confidence
    multiplier = 1.2         # Risk 3.0%
elif confidence_score >= 2: # Medium confidence  
    multiplier = 1.0         # Risk 2.5%
elif confidence_score >= 0: # Low confidence
    multiplier = 0.9         # Risk 2.25%
else:                        # Negative confidence
    multiplier = 0.8         # Risk 2.0%

final_risk_target = min(max_target_pct, max(min_target_pct, base_target_pct * multiplier))
```

**Example:**
- Position notional: $10,000
- Confidence score: 4 (high confidence)
- Risk target: 3.0% (2.5% × 1.2)
- **Dollar risk**: $10,000 × 0.03 = $300

---

### 🔗 **3. Can Correlation Threshold and Cluster Risk Cap be calibrated?**

**Yes, both parameters are fully configurable** and should be calibrated based on your trading strategy and market conditions.

**Correlation Threshold (`corr_threshold`)**:
- **Default**: 0.7 (70% correlation)
- **Range**: 0.5 - 0.9 recommended
- **Purpose**: Determines when positions are considered "correlated" and grouped into clusters
- **Lower values**: More aggressive clustering (more positions grouped together)
- **Higher values**: More conservative clustering (only highly correlated positions grouped)

**Cluster Risk Cap (`cluster_risk_cap_pct`)**:
- **Default**: 0.5 (50% of total portfolio risk)
- **Range**: 0.3 - 0.8 recommended  
- **Purpose**: Maximum percentage of total portfolio risk allowed per correlated cluster
- **Lower values**: More conservative (better diversification)
- **Higher values**: More aggressive (allows concentrated exposure)

**Configuration Example:**
```toml
[portfolio]
corr_threshold = 0.7        # 70% correlation threshold
cluster_risk_cap_pct = 0.5  # Max 50% of total risk per cluster

# Alternative conservative settings
# corr_threshold = 0.6        # 60% correlation (more clustering)
# cluster_risk_cap_pct = 0.4  # Max 40% of total risk per cluster
```

**Calibration Guidelines:**
- **Crypto Markets**: Use 0.6-0.7 threshold (crypto assets are highly correlated)
- **Mixed Assets**: Use 0.7-0.8 threshold (stocks, forex, commodities)
- **Risk Tolerance**: Lower cluster cap (0.3-0.4) for conservative, higher (0.6-0.8) for aggressive

---

### ⚖️ **4. Do exposure increase/decrease suggestions account for both clustering and risk limits?**

**Yes, the system considers both clustering effects and individual risk limits** when making exposure recommendations. The process follows this hierarchy:

**Decision Process:**
1. **Individual Position Analysis**: Calculate optimal size based on confidence score and risk target
2. **Cluster Risk Assessment**: Group correlated positions and calculate total cluster risk
3. **Risk Cap Application**: If cluster risk exceeds limits, proportionally scale down all positions in that cluster
4. **Final Recommendations**: Suggest increases/decreases based on the constrained optimal sizes

**Example Scenario:**
```
Initial Analysis:
- BTC position: Optimal size $15,000 (risk: $450)
- ETH position: Optimal size $12,000 (risk: $360) 
- SOL position: Optimal size $8,000 (risk: $240)
- Cluster correlation: 0.8 (above 0.7 threshold)
- Total cluster risk: $1,050

Risk Cap Check:
- Max cluster risk allowed: $800 (50% of $1,600 total portfolio risk)
- Scale factor: $800 / $1,050 = 0.76

Final Recommendations:
- BTC: Reduce to $11,400 (76% of optimal)
- ETH: Reduce to $9,120 (76% of optimal)
- SOL: Reduce to $6,080 (76% of optimal)
```

**Output Example:**
```
Portfolio Note: Cluster [BTC, ETH, SOL] risk capped $1,050→$800 (ρ≥0.7)
Recommendation: Reduce BTC exposure by 24% due to cluster risk limits
```

### 🎯 **5. How is Confidence Score calculated and where is it used?**

**Confidence Score** is a **0-5 point system** that evaluates trade setup quality based on five technical factors:

**Calculation Components:**

1. **Trend Strength (EMA Crossover)** [+1 point]:
   - **Long**: EMA20 > EMA50 (uptrend alignment)
   - **Short**: EMA20 < EMA50 (downtrend alignment)

2. **Breakout Confirmation (Donchian Channels)** [+1 point]:
   - **Long**: Price breaks above 20-period high
   - **Short**: Price breaks below 20-period low

3. **Volatility Regime Analysis** [+1/-1 point]:
   - **+1**: Low volatility regime (current vol < 80% of median)
   - **-1**: High volatility regime (current vol > 150% of median)

4. **Price Momentum (RSI)** [+1 point]:
   - **Long**: RSI > 50 (positive momentum)
   - **Short**: RSI < 50 (negative momentum)

5. **Volatility Model Alignment** [+1/-1 point]:
   - **+1**: GARCH and HAR models agree (ratio 0.5-2.0)
   - **-1**: Models strongly disagree (ratio > 3.0)

**Usage Throughout System:**

**1. Risk Target Adjustment:**
```python
if confidence_score >= 4:    # High confidence
    risk_multiplier = 1.2    # Risk 20% more
elif confidence_score >= 2: # Medium confidence
    risk_multiplier = 1.0    # Standard risk
elif confidence_score >= 0: # Low confidence  
    risk_multiplier = 0.9    # Risk 10% less
else:                        # Negative confidence
    risk_multiplier = 0.8    # Risk 20% less
```

**2. Stop-Loss Adjustment:**
```python
confidence_adjustment = 1.0 + (confidence_score * 0.05)  # ±25% based on confidence
adjusted_stop_distance = base_stop_distance * confidence_adjustment
```

**3. Position Sizing:**
```python
optimal_size = (risk_target_pct * notional) / stop_loss_distance
# Where risk_target_pct is adjusted by confidence score
```

**Example Output:**
```
Symbol: BTC/USDT
Confidence Score: 4/5
Contributing Factors:
  ✓ Uptrend (EMA20 > EMA50)
  ✓ Breakout above Donchian high  
  ✓ Low volatility regime
  ✓ Positive momentum (RSI > 50)
Risk Target: 3.0% (base 2.5% × 1.2 confidence multiplier)
```
