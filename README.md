## üöÄ Quick Start

There are two ways to run the application: directly via `pip` or using Docker.

### 1. Local Installation & Execution

#### Installation

First, clone the repository and navigate into the directory. It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone <repository>
cd <repository-folder>

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```
Installing with `-e .` makes the `risk-manager` command available on your path and reflects any code changes you make immediately.

#### Configuration

1.  Copy `settings.example.toml` to `settings.toml`.
2.  Add your Bybit API credentials to `settings.toml`.
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API credentials (this is read by the application):
    ```
    BYBIT_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    BYBIT_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
    ```

#### Running the Application

Once installed, you can run the analysis using the new command-line tool:

```bash
risk-manager
```

### 2. Docker Execution

Alternatively, you can use Docker to build and run the application in a containerized environment.

#### Building the Image

From the project root directory, build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t risk-manager-app .
```

#### Running the Container

Run the application inside a Docker container. You will need to mount your `.env` file and `settings.toml` into the container so it can access your configuration and API keys.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/.env":/app/.env -v "$(pwd)/settings.toml":/app/settings.toml risk-manager-app
```
The `--rm` flag will automatically remove the container when it exits. The `-v` flags mount your local configuration files into the container at runtime.

### üî¨ Running Tests

A suite of unit tests is included to verify the core calculation logic. To run the tests:

1.  Install the package in editable mode with the optional `test` dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .[test]
    ```

2.  Run the test suite from the project's root directory:
    ```bash
    pytest -v
    ```

## üÜï Recent Updates

- Kelly verbose output: Enabled by default. When `risk.verbose_kelly = true` (default), each analyzed position logs a single-line summary with Kelly inputs and result: `Kelly: p_win=0.632, odds=1.850, f*=0.3125, risk$=125.00, mode=cap`.
- Kelly configuration: `risk.use_kelly = true` (default), `risk.kelly_mode = "cap" | "override"` (default: `cap`), `risk.kelly_scale` (default: `0.5`), optional `risk.kelly_fraction_cap`, and `risk.kelly_decimal_precision` for high-precision math.
- R:R fallback logic: If computed dollar risk is zero, the system now falls back to the structural ratio `TP_distance / SL_distance` to avoid misleading `0.0:1` displays.
- Consistent numeric formatting: Quick Reference Table shows R:R with two decimals to match the report; Kelly line formats as `p_win` (3 decimals), `odds` (3 decimals), `f*` (4 decimals), and `risk$` (2 decimals) for easy comparison.

To toggle verbosity, set in your `settings.toml` under the `[risk]` section:

```toml
[risk]
use_kelly = true
kelly_mode = "cap"      # or "override"
verbose_kelly = true     # set to false to silence the Kelly line per-position
kelly_scale = 0.5        # practitioner half-Kelly
# kelly_fraction_cap = 0.25
# kelly_decimal_precision = 28
```

### üß† Advanced Risk Logic Explained

Beyond simple volatility metrics, the system employs a multi-layered approach to dynamically adjust risk parameters based on market conditions and trade confidence. This results in more nuanced and context-aware risk management.

#### 1. Confidence Scoring Model

Instead of treating all trade setups equally, the system calculates a **Confidence Score** for each position to quantify the quality of the setup. This score is based on a blend of five distinct factors:

1.  **Trend Strength (EMA Crossover):** Checks if the short-term trend (20-period EMA) is aligned with the position's direction relative to the longer-term trend (50-period EMA). A score is awarded if the trend is favorable.
2.  **Breakout Confirmation (Donchian Channels):** Determines if the current price has recently broken out of its 20-period price range, providing confirmation for the trade's direction.
3.  **Volatility Regime:** Compares the short-term volatility (20-period standard deviation of returns) to the longer-term median volatility (100-period). A score is awarded for low-volatility regimes (less noise) and penalized for high-volatility regimes.
4.  **Price Momentum (RSI Proxy):** Uses a 14-period RSI calculation to gauge momentum. A score is awarded if the RSI is above 50 for long positions or below 50 for short positions.
5.  **Volatility Model Stability:** Compares the annualized volatility forecasts from the GARCH and HAR-RV models. If the models are in close agreement, it increases confidence. If they diverge significantly, it reduces confidence, indicating market uncertainty.

The final score is clamped between -2 and +5 and directly influences the risk parameters.

#### 2. Dynamic Risk Target Adjustment

The system can dynamically adjust the percentage of capital risked on a trade based on the **Confidence Score**. This allows for taking slightly more risk on high-quality setups and less risk on low-quality ones.

-   The base risk is defined in `settings.toml` (e.g., `base_target_pct = 0.025`).
-   A multiplier is applied based on the score:
    -   High Confidence (Score ‚â• 4): **1.2x** multiplier (e.g., 3.0% risk)
    -   Medium Confidence (Score ‚â• 2): **1.0x** multiplier (e.g., 2.5% risk)
    -   Low Confidence (Score ‚â• 0): **0.9x** multiplier (e.g., 2.25% risk)
    -   Negative Confidence (Score < 0): **0.8x** multiplier (e.g., 2.0% risk)
-   The final risk target is clipped within a professional range (e.g., 2.0% to 3.0%) defined in the configuration.

#### 3. Dynamic Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Multipliers

The multipliers used to set the Stop-Loss (`k`) and Take-Profit (`m`) distances are not static. they are adjusted using a three-factor model to adapt to market conditions:

1.  **Base Multiplier (Leverage):** The initial `k` and `m` values are selected from the configuration based on the position's leverage. Higher leverage results in tighter base multipliers.
2.  **Volatility Adjustment:** The multipliers are then adjusted based on the current volatility regime (measured by ATR as a percentage of price). In very high-volatility environments, stops are widened to avoid premature stop-outs, while in low-volatility environments, they are tightened.
3.  **Confidence Adjustment:** Finally, the multipliers are fine-tuned based on the **Confidence Score**. A higher score results in slightly tighter stops and more aggressive profit targets, as the system has more confidence in the trade's direction.

This multi-factor approach ensures that the final SL/TP levels are tailored specifically to the asset's current leverage, volatility, and the quality of the trade setup.

### 2. GARCH Volatility Triggers (`garch_vol_triggers.py`)

Advanced volatility analysis using multiple models:

**Volatility Models:**

#### GARCH(1,1) Model
- Models volatility clustering and mean reversion
- Provides short-term volatility forecasts
- More sensitive to recent market conditions
- Weight: 30% in blended estimate

#### HAR-RV (Heterogeneous Autoregressive Realized Volatility)
- Uses realized volatility from different time horizons
- More stable long-term volatility estimates
- Better for trend-following strategies
- Weight: 40% in blended estimate

#### ATR (Average True Range)
- Simple volatility measure based on price ranges
- Used as fallback when advanced models fail
- Good for quick volatility assessment
- Weight: 30% in blended estimate

**Blending Logic:**
```python
# Outlier detection and blending
if garch_sigma and har_sigma:
    ratio = garch_sigma / har_sigma
    if ratio > outlier_threshold:
        # Use HAR if GARCH is outlier
        blended_sigma = har_sigma
    else:
        # Weighted blend
        blended_sigma = (w_garch * garch_sigma + 
                        w_har * har_sigma + 
                        w_atr * atr_sigma)
else:
    # Fallback to ATR
    blended_sigma = atr_sigma
```

### 3. Portfolio Correlation Analysis

**New Feature**: Automatically identifies correlated positions and applies risk caps:

```python
# Correlation clustering algorithm
1. Fetch 4h returns for all positions (60-day lookback)
2. Calculate correlation matrix
3. Group positions with |correlation| ‚â• 0.7 into clusters
4. Cap total cluster risk at 50% of portfolio risk budget
5. Scale down cluster members proportionally
```

**Example Output:**
```

### Risk/Reward Calculation Logic

The system calculates risk/reward using **optimal position sizing**:

1. **Target Risk**: Configurable (default 2.5% of position notional)
2. **Volatility Forecast**: Uses blended GARCH/HAR-RV/ATR models
3. **SL Distance**: `k √ó œÉ_H √ó entry_price` (k = 0.8-1.8 based on leverage)
4. **TP Distance**: `m √ó œÉ_H √ó entry_price` (m = 1.8-4.0 based on leverage)
5. **Optimal Size**: `target_risk / sl_distance`
6. **Risk/Reward**: `tp_distance / sl_distance`

### Position Sizing Recommendations

The system compares current vs optimal position sizes:

- **Current < 0.5√ó Optimal**: Position too small for proper risk management
- **Current > 1.5√ó Optimal**: Position too large, consider reducing
- **0.5√ó ‚â§ Current ‚â§ 1.5√ó Optimal**: Position size appropriate

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

```

## üìà Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Position Analysis
```bash
python position_risk_manager.py
```

### 1b. Push risk orders after analysis
```python
from market_analysis.position_risk_manager import PositionRiskManager

manager = PositionRiskManager()
manager.fetch_positions()
manager.display_positions()         # quick view in notebooks
manager.analyze_all_positions()

# Review the report first, then submit protective orders (dry run first!)
manager.execute_risk_orders(dry_run=True)
# manager.execute_risk_orders(dry_run=False)
manager.display_orders()            # confirm submitted orders
```

### 2. Custom Volatility Analysis
```python
from garch_vol_triggers import analyze_multiple_symbols_bybit

# Analyze multiple symbols
symbols = ["BTC/USDT", "ETH/USDT", "SOL/USDT"]
results = analyze_multiple_symbols_bybit(symbols, timeframe="4h", days_back=90)
```

### 3. Individual Symbol Analysis
```python
from garch_vol_triggers import get_klines_bybit, garch_sigma_ann_and_sigma_H

# Get data and analyze
df = get_klines_bybit("BTC/USDT", "1h", days_back=30)
sigma_ann, sigma_H, garch_res = garch_sigma_ann_and_sigma_H(df["close"])
```

### 4. Configuration Management
```python
from position_risk_manager import load_settings

# Load configuration with fallback
cfg = load_settings("settings.toml")
risk_target = cfg.get('risk', {}).get('base_target_pct', 0.025)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No module named 'pandas'"**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **"Error fetching data from Bybit"**
   - Check API credentials in `settings.toml`
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check if using correct symbol format (e.g., "BTC/USDT:USDT" for Bybit)

3. **"GARCH failed"**
   - Need at least 500 data points for stable GARCH fit
   - Try increasing `lookback_days` parameter

4. **"HAR-RV failed"**
   - Need sufficient historical data
   - Try different timeframe or longer lookback period

5. **"Configuration not found"**
   - Copy `settings.example.toml` to `settings.toml`
   - System will use defaults if no config file exists

### Performance Tips

- Use `sandbox=True` for testing
- Reduce `lookback_days` for faster analysis
- Cache volatility calculations for frequently analyzed symbols
- Adjust correlation settings for your portfolio size

## üìö Technical Details

### Volatility Models

#### GARCH(1,1) Model
```
œÉ¬≤_t = œâ + Œ±‚ÇÅr¬≤_{t-1} + Œ≤‚ÇÅœÉ¬≤_{t-1}
```
Where:
- `œÉ¬≤_t`: Conditional variance at time t
- `r¬≤_{t-1}`: Squared return at time t-1
- `œâ, Œ±‚ÇÅ, Œ≤‚ÇÅ`: Model parameters

#### HAR-RV Model
```
log(RV_{t+1}) = c + Œ≤_D log(RV_D) + Œ≤_W log(RV_W) + Œ≤_M log(RV_M)
```
Where:
- `RV_D`: Daily realized volatility
- `RV_W`: Weekly realized volatility  
- `RV_M`: Monthly realized volatility

### Risk Calculation Formula

```
SL_distance = k √ó œÉ_H √ó entry_price
TP_distance = m √ó œÉ_H √ó entry_price
Optimal_Size = target_risk / SL_distance
```

Where `œÉ_H` is the volatility forecast for the target horizon.

### Correlation Analysis Algorithm

```
1. Fetch 4h returns for all positions (configurable lookback)
2. Calculate pairwise correlation matrix
3. Apply threshold-based clustering:
   - Start with each symbol as its own cluster
   - Merge clusters if any member has |corr| ‚â• threshold
4. For each cluster:
   - Calculate total cluster risk
   - If cluster risk > cap_pct √ó total_risk:
     - Scale down all cluster members proportionally
```
